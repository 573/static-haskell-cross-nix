As https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-11-25-asterius-th/ (via https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/124284#issuecomment-861432498) states certain parts of haskell code will run at compile time as soon as Template Haskell is used, so when building on build machines with one instruction set for host machines with another instruction set, the codes run at compile time may if not fail from the start be translated disorthogonally and fail subtly at runtime. The thing to be done is some RPC sorcery via so-called iserv enabling to communicate to an emulator (be wine or qemu whatsoever), which itself does all the foreign platform computation pushing back the results to build machines ghc.
It is said that haskell.nix includes this at least for cross-compiling to Windows host machines. My hope and aim of this essay is it supported cross-compiling to aarch64 as well.
